# Rings.lean — a residue/divisibility reformulation of the sieve

A restatement of the sieve in terms of residues modulo the base primes. It is logically
equivalent to the coprimality formulation, but organized around the divisibility conditions
`p ∣ n` (residues `n mod p`) rather than the single gcd condition.

For a prime `p`:
  • `p` divides `n`  ⟺  `n ≡ 0 (mod p)`;
  • `n` is a *void* for a set `S` of primes if no `p ∈ S` divides `n`;
  • these conditions are defined for all `n`, with no anchor or window.

The anchor `Pk` and the window `(Pk, 2Pk]` enter only when the residue conditions are
restricted to that interval (`gps_free`).

NOTE: this file does not itself close non-emptiness of the window (that is
`dense_sieve_survivor`, closed in `GPS_StateMachine` via the certificate). It provides the
residue/divisibility formulation and its equivalence with coprimality.

exclusively by the base (≤Pk), never by an in-window survivor. It fails immediately past `2Pk`
(the first such multiple is `2·(Pk+1)`). Small bases are no exception: the property is universal
(no threshold `Pk>7`); a small window is simply too narrow to contain such a multiple —
narrowness, not a threshold. -/

A numerical test shows that the symmetry `[2,Pmax] ↔ (Pmax,2Pmax]` is NOT a coordinate
reflection: no map `n ↦ c−n` carries voids to primes. The actual invariance is
self-similarity across scale: the sieve law has the same form at every anchor, and every prime

next scale. -/

    `sigma ≥ coveredCount`. Hence `sigma` alone does NOT close `coveredCount < Pk`, because
    `sigma > Pk`. The closure lives in `coveredCount = sigma − overlaps`: the goal

/-! ## Telescope identity — disjoint decomposition of coverage by minFac

`coveredCount` decomposes DISJOINTLY into fibers by least prime factor:
`coveredCount Pk = Σ_{p<Pk prime} A_p`, where `A_p = #{n∈(Pk,2Pk] : minFac n = p}`.
This is "the structure counts once" in Lean: every covered position falls into exactly ONE
fiber (its own minFac), so there is no double counting (the multiplicity disappears — a
disjoint sum, not a `Σ` with multiplicity). By `window_composite_minFac_sq_le` only the fibers
`p ≤ √(2Pk)` are nonzero. -/

/-! ## Generalized window (Pmax, Pmin·Pmax] — architecture of the generalized family

Bertrand is the instance `Pmin = 2`. For larger `Pmin` the window is WIDER (looser), and the
wide end is FREE (a Euclid witness). The whole weight is the descent in `Pmin` down to `2` —
we do not "prove" Bertrand separately; it is a member of the proven family.

Structural note (fact): self-containment (`window_self_contained_dvd`) holds ONLY for
`Pmin = 2` — wider windows contain `2·(Pmax+1)` and are not self-contained. The tightest window
therefore carries the most structure, which is exactly the case hardest to establish. -/

/-! ## Proof by contradiction — assume "empty window" and derive the forced parameters

Assume the window `(Pk, 2Pk]` is EMPTY (fully covered by composites). We derive what MUST hold:
(1) every position must be covered by a ring from the FULL BASE `p < Pk` (a ring `> Pk` has
first multiple `2·(>Pk) > 2Pk`, outside the window — it covers NOTHING); (2) the disjoint sum
of coverages `Σ_{p<Pk} A_p` must fill the ENTIRE window: `= Pk`. No `√` here — full base, reach
`2Pk`.

Trichotomy of failure: for this to hold, one of the following would have to break:
  • STRUCTURAL SIEVE — `Σ A_p = Pk` contradicts `Σ A_p < Pk` (the atom),
  • 2Pmax — a prime position would require a ring `> Pk` (its only divisor is itself), whose
    multiple falls `> 2Pk` (outside the window),
  • PEANO/offsets — the offsets of the base rings `< Pk` would have to cover all `Pk` positions,
    even though the density of the union is `1 − ∏(1−1/p) < 1`.
Parts (1)+(2) are proved WITHOUT the atom; the contradiction remains on the atom. -/

`decide`, which literally runs the sieve inside the proof — INDEPENDENTLY of the atom

/-! ## Test of a logical connective — the dichotomy "empty window ⇒ larger base / other bound"

Proposed connective: "the window cannot be empty, because a void would force a larger base,
and a larger base means a different Pmax; and if the base and Pmax stay, the only remaining
route is a bound other than 2Pmax — but 2Pmax is an arithmetic bound."

Result of the formal test (below, by machine):

(1) An empty window does NOT force a larger base. It forces exactly this: the next prime lies
    `> 2Pk`, and the base of primes `< Pk` stays THE SAME (`fullCoverage_means_next_prime_far`
    — provable, no contradiction). The step "void ⇒ larger base" tacitly assumes the current
    base CANNOT cover the window — precisely the thesis the connective was meant to prove
    (petitio principii). There is no contradiction with the laws of arithmetic here.

(2) Position enters through ONE fact: the window elements are small (`n ≤ 2Pk`), so a composite
    has a factor `≤ √(2Pk)` (`window_composite_minFac_sq_le`). This restricts the covering primes
    from the full base to the TRUNCATED base — and only for the latter does the question "can it
    cover Pk consecutive positions" have a chance of answering NO. This is the true "geometry of
    numbers": the Jacobsthal function of the truncated primorial. Reduction below
    (`windowHasVoid_iff_trunc_coprime`).

Gap table (computed): base {2,3,5}: g=6 vs windows from Pk=13 (margin ×2.2);
{2,3,5,7}: g=10 vs Pk≥29 (×2.9); {…,11}: g=14 vs Pk≥61 (×4.4); {…,13}: g=22 vs Pk≥89 (×4.0);
{…,17}: g=26 vs Pk≥149 (×5.7); {…,19}: g=34 vs Pk≥181 (×5.3). The margin grows (OEIS A048670),
but the GENERAL inequality `g(truncPrimorial Pk) ≤ Pk` is quantitative — of the order of

/-! ## The deterministic zone Pk² — formalized

The coupling of the base with its reach, formalized: the equivalence "void ⟺ prime" holds in
the ENTIRE zone `(Pk, Pk²)`, not only in the window. Inside the zone a gap of coprimes is
LITERALLY a gap between primes (no CRT freedom). Only above `Pk²` does the equivalence break
(`determinism_breaks_above`), and CRT periodicity produces long gaps unrelated to primes. This
is why a "counterexample" like 9440–9460 (base of primes < 17) can exist only outside its
base's zone: `17² = 289 < 9440`.

The honest other side: inside the zone, "a gap ≥ Pk just past Pk" now reads "a prime gap ≥ Pk
past Pk" — the equivalence renames the atom, it does not prove it. -/

/-! ## The staircase of regimes — each truncated-base regime closed by ONE period

The pattern of `windowHasVoid_of_trunc30` generalized: the gap law `g(M) ≤ g` checked on one
period `M` (`decide`, kernel-checked -- windows here are never at an arbitrary position, so
Jacobsthal's worst-case bound doesn't apply and the periodic check needs no `native_decide`
hedge) + periodicity = a void in ALL windows of the regime
`truncPrimorial Pk = M`, without looking into the window. The staircase (computed):
  {2,3,5}    → g(30)   = 6  → Pk = 13, 17, 19, 23          (margin ×2.2)
  {2,3,5,7}  → g(210)  = 10 → Pk = 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59   (×2.9)
  {…,11}     → g(2310) = 14 → Pk = 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83   (×4.4)

Generalization of truncated arithmetic: we prove statements about the FAMILY of windows
`(Pmax, Pmin·Pmax]`, Bertrand being the tightest variant `Pmin = 2`. The reduction carries over
directly:

  a void in `(Pmax, Pmin·Pmax]`  ⟺  a number coprime to `∏ {p < Pmax : p² ≤ Pmin·Pmax}`.

**Estimate for the family (how to estimate for Pmax → Pmin·Pmax):** the family atom is
`g(gtruncPrimorial) ≤ (Pmin−1)·Pmax`. With `y = √(Pmin·Pmax)` one needs
`g(∏ p≤y) ≤ (1 − 1/Pmin)·y²`. The Jacobsthal CONSTANT of the family is `1 − 1/Pmin`:
  · `Pmin = 2` (Bertrand): constant `1/2` — tightest, the family kernel;
  · `Pmin` grows: constant → `1` — exactly the order of Iwaniec's theorem `g ≪ y²`;
  · `Pmin·Pmax ≥ primorial+1`: free (`gwindowHasVoid_of_wide`, Euclid).
The descent in Pmin to 2 = sharpening the constant from 1 to 1/2. Each truncated-base regime
closes for ALL Pmin at once by one period (below: {2,3,5} simultaneously closes the (2,17],
(3,11], (4,9], (5,7) families). Note on variant A: Erdős-type counting also generalizes
(Sylvester–Erdős, C(Pmin·n, n)) — but it remains counting; in B we stay with gap geometry. -/

/-! ## Inclusion–exclusion (Legendre) identity

This is inclusion–exclusion over the truncated base. Its core is ONE recursive step: adjoining
a prime `p` to a set with product `M` splits the survivors into those also coprime to `p`, plus
a copy of the whole problem at scale `1/p`:

    #surv(S∪{p}, (a,b]]  =  #surv(S, (a,b]]  −  #surv(S, (a/p, b/p]]

(here in additive form, avoiding subtraction in ℕ). Unfolding this recursion over all primes is
exactly the Legendre sum `Σ_T (−1)^{|T|}·…` at full depth. The identity is exact (verified:
P=101→20, 503→72, 1009→137, 5003→559). The partial sums by order oscillate
(1009→−647→489→83→137); positivity of the full sum for EVERY window at once is the atom. -/

/-- **The anchor is idle in its own window (equivalence of conventions).** The survivors in
    `(Pk, 2Pk]` with respect to the base `≤ Pk` (where the base maximum defines the window) and
    with respect to the base `< Pk` (where the anchor is itself a survivor and the smaller base
    does the sieving) are THE SAME set. Reason: the only multiple of `Pk` in the window is `2Pk`,
    which is divisible by `2`. No result of the project depends on the choice of convention. -/

/-! ## The S1 purity law and the central binomial coefficient

The central binomial coefficient `C(2n,n)` is a classical object; Erdős used it. Its prime
content in the window is controlled by the source purity law (S1 — in Lean
`window_composite_smooth`/`window_self_contained_dvd`): a source `q ∈ (n, 2n]` divides `(2n)!`
exactly once, because its first multiple `2q` exceeds `2n` (`2q > 2n`), and does not divide
`(n!)²` at all (`q > n`). This is the same role of `2` and the same self-containment as at
`Pmin = 2`. -/
