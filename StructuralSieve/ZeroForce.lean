# ZeroForce.lean — Lemma 4.3: Zero Effective Force

When P_k is added to a complete generative base, it contributes **zero new coverage**
to its own window `(P_k, 2·P_k]`.

**Reason**: the only multiple of P_k in `(P_k, 2·P_k]` is `2·P_k = 2 · P_k`,
which is already divisible by `2` — the minimal prime, always present in the
preceding base `𝒫' = {P_1, …, P_{k−1}}`.

**Corollary** (exact, no approximation):
  `n ∈ (P_k, 2·P_k]` is composite  ↔  `n.minFac < P_k`  or  `n = 2·P_k`.
In both cases `n` is already covered by `𝒫'`.
Hence composites in the window are **exactly** the elements covered by the
preceding base `𝒫'`.

**Lemma 4.3** (Zero Effective Force).

The only multiple of an odd prime `P_k` in the window `(P_k, 2·P_k]` is `2·P_k`.
Since `2 ∣ 2·P_k`, this element is covered by the factor `2` already present in
the preceding base.  Therefore `P_k` adds no new coverage to its own window.

**Corollary 4.4** (Composites are covered by the preceding base).

For every composite `n ∈ (P_k, 2·P_k]`, either:
- `n.minFac < P_k`  (covered by a prime strictly smaller than P_k, hence in 𝒫'), or
- `n = 2·P_k`       (covered by `2`, the minimal element of 𝒫').

In either case `n` is sieve-covered by the preceding base `𝒫'`.
This result is **exact** — it uses only divisibility, not density.

**Remark**: the converse also holds.

Any element `n ∈ (P_k, 2·P_k]` with `n.minFac > P_k` must be prime
(Corollary 3.2).  Combined with `composites_covered_by_prev`, we obtain
the exact characterization:
  `n ∈ (P_k, 2·P_k]` is prime  ↔  `n` is NOT covered by the preceding base `𝒫'`.
