# BinomialCertificate.lean — the self-contained binomial contradiction

`binomial_contradiction` closes the quantitative atom entirely within our own development:
for `2 < n`, an empty window `(n, 2n]` is impossible. It imports only

* `BinomialBound` — the upper bound `window_centralBinom_le`, reproved from Legendre/Kummer +
  primorial primitives (the Erdős-specific content, ours);
* `Threshold` — the prime-free size inequality `threshold_inequality`;
* `Mathlib.Data.Nat.Choose.Central` — the lower bound `four_pow_lt_mul_centralBinom`
  (`4^n < n · C(2n,n)`) and the definition of `centralBinom`.

Crucially it does NOT import `Mathlib.NumberTheory.Bertrand`: the closure is assembled from
the two bounds on `C(2n,n)` plus a computational oracle for the small cases, none of which is
Mathlib's Bertrand theorem. Plugs into `WindowCertificate` as instance B.

/-- **Small windows (`2 < n < 512`).** A prime in `(n, 2n]`, no `native_decide`.
    Two earlier attempts both crashed the native kernel stack:
    (1) chunking only the outer `n`-range and leaving `∃ p < 1024` as one `decide` —
    that inner search alone is past the depth ceiling (`jacobsthal_210` at 210 safe,
    `jacobsthal_2310` at 2310 not, Rings.lean);
    (2) eliminating the search via explicit witnesses but running `interval_cases n`
    on the full width-509 range in one call — 509 is itself past the same ceiling,
    independent of what closes each branch, since `interval_cases`'s case split is
    exactly the kind of construction the ceiling bounds.
    Fix so far: split the width-509 range into sixteen 32-wide chunks (`rcases
    lt_or_ge`, comfortably under the 210 mark) and run `interval_cases n` only inside
    each 32-wide chunk.
    Third pass (2026-09-19): within each chunk, a shared `witness_search` macro used
    to try every prime below 1024 in increasing order (via `first`) until one satisfied
    `n < p ≤ 2n` — up to 172 candidate `decide` calls per literal `n`, ~87,500 total
    across all 509 cases. That is cheap enough for a patient local build (`maxHeartbeats`
    already raised for exactly this reason) but far too slow for a resource-limited CI
    sandbox (Palomar's Comparator runs in a constrained sandbox with its own time/memory
    ceiling, independent of Lean's own heartbeat budget) — the whole-file build was
    observed taking ~30 minutes locally, which a stricter external sandbox timeout can
    kill outright. Replaced the blind search with a precomputed witness table: each of
    the 509 literal `n` gets its own single `exact ⟨p, by decide⟩` with the exact correct
    `p` (computed and independently verified in Python — smallest prime with
    `n < p ≤ 2n`), cutting per-case cost from up to 172 `decide` attempts down to exactly
    one. (Same statement as `Erdos.small_window_prime`, redefined here so this file stays
    free of the Bertrand import.) -/

/-- **Self-contained quantitative kernel.** For `2 < n`, if `(n, 2n]` has no prime then a
    contradiction follows: the lower bound `4^n < n · C(2n,n)` and the empty-window upper bound
    `window_centralBinom_le` on the same integer `C(2n,n)` are incompatible. Built without
    Mathlib's Bertrand theorem. -/
