# Truncated.lean — Truncated arithmetic: the sparse-base regime (closed, no `sorry`)

This is the unconditionally closable part of Section 7 / Corollary 7.1 of the paper.

**What is not here:** the general Corollary 7.1 for all `P_min`. For `P_min = 2` the window
`(P_max, P_min·P_max]` equals `(P_max, 2·P_max]`, so the general statement would imply
Bertrand, and that requires a size estimate — the quantitative certificate in `Erdos.lean`.

**What is here:** the regime in which a purely structural argument (a union bound) already
suffices: when the total number of covered positions is smaller than the size of the window.
This is exactly the integer form of the condition `Σ_{p ∈ base} 1/p < 1`. Bertrand
(`P_min = 2`) lies outside this regime, since there `Σ 1/p` diverges; this single lemma is
therefore the exact boundary between "structure suffices" and "a size estimate is needed".

Proof: cardinality of a finite union (`card_biUnion_le`) plus the pigeonhole principle. No
analysis.

**Union bound (core of the sparse-base regime).**

If, in the window `(lo, hi]`, the total number of multiples of the base elements `B` is
smaller than the size of the window, then some window element is uncovered by every element
of `B` (irreducible with respect to `B`). Purely combinatorial, with no size estimate.

**Corollary 7.1 (sparse-base regime).**

The window `(P_max, P_min·P_max]` cannot be sieve-closed by the base `B` whenever the base
is sufficiently sparse: the total number of multiples is smaller than the window size. Then
an uncovered element exists (irreducible with respect to `B`), so the interval is not
sieve-closed.

For `P_min = 2` (Bertrand) the hypothesis `hsparse` fails — the sum meets or exceeds the
window size, since `Σ 1/p` diverges — so this lemma does not yield Bertrand. This is the
precise formal description of the regime boundary.
